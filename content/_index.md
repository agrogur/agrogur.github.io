# Hello, I am UÄŸur. ðŸŒŸ

**Welcome to my home on the internet, you bring joy!**


<div style='text-align: justify;'>

In addition to my other competencies, I am a computer programming student based in Istanbul.

I learned this concept thanks to both of Jekyll & Hugo (indeed, it is a long story)  and a little bit from Github. It didnâ€™t take me long to realize that this was what I had been looking for for years.

I would like to record here what I have done so far, as well as what I could not do, things I was afraid to express, my self-learning process and its results. In my opinion, Digital Garden is the technological reflection of holistic management in scientific terms.
 
I want to turn this place into a kind of treasure trove of information and combine its pieces with a holistic approach. So if you would like to contact me, I would be very grateful.
